# Kafka Streams

[Kafka Streams](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/) is a client library for building applications and microservices, where the input and output data are stored in Kafka clusters. It combines the simplicity of writing and deploying standard Java and Scala applications on the client side with the benefits of Kafka's server-side cluster technology.
